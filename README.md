# Cool Particle Bacground for websites !
this small repo is about a particle background for a website, that can be customised to fit anyone's needs.

### how does it work ?
this simple animated background can be customised by changing the javascript and css files.

***PARTICLE_NUMBER_FG*** : defines how many particles there are in the forground.<br />
***PARTICLE_NUMBER_BG*** : defines how many particles there are in the background.<br />
***SPEED_FACTOR_FG*** : defines how fast the particles are moving, higher is faster.<br />
***distanceThresh*** : defines the threshold to start drawing a line between the particles, lower means that the lines will be drawn when 2 particles are close to eachother.<br />
***lineOppacity*** : an integer >= 1, defines the opacity of the line, higher is more transparent, lower is more opaque.<br />
***lineColor*** : has to be either **rgba** or **rgb**.<br />
